## 💡 About
A simple but powerful program that converts **Celsius** temperature into both **Fahrenheit** and **Kelvin** using direct arithmetic formulas.  
Perfect for beginners learning `printf()` and `scanf()` usage!

---

## ⚙️ Formula Used
- Fahrenheit = (C × 9/5) + 32  
- Kelvin = C + 273.15  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Variables  
- Data types (`float`)  
- Input/Output (`scanf()` & `printf()`)  
- Arithmetic operators  

---

🧰 **Tools & Tech**

- **Language:** C  
- **IDE:** Any C Compiler (VS Code, Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, etc.)  
- **Platform:** Windows / Linux / macOS  

---

📚 **What I Learned**

- Using `printf()` and `scanf()` for input/output operations  
- Performing arithmetic calculations using variables and operators  
- Applying real-world physics formulas (Celsius → Fahrenheit → Kelvin) in C  
- Understanding the use of **float precision** for accurate decimal outputs  
- Structuring clean, readable code with proper formatting and comments
